                    After facing another year of criticism for allowing fake news on Facebook, 
                    CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his priority in 2019 is tackling social issues.
                    In July 2019, the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion, its 
                    largest penalty in 
                    history, for violating consumers' privacy.
                    Zuckerberg started Facebook at Harvard in 2004 at the age of 19 for 
                    students to match names
                    with photos of classmates.
                    He took Facebook public in May 2012 and still owns about 15% of the stock.
                    In December 2015, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, pledged to
                     give away 99% of their Facebook stake over their lifetimes.

                    Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul 
                    Allen founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, 
                    through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics.
                     In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates 
                     announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his 
                     foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

                    A former English teacher, Jack Ma cofounded Alibaba Group, one of the world's largest e-commerce businesses.
                    In September 2019, Jack Ma stepped down as Alibaba's executive chairman; he is succeeded by CEO Daniel Zhang.
                    Its 2014 IPO in New York set a record as the world's biggest public stock offering, raising $25 billion.
                    Ma's investments beyond Alibaba include stakes in Chinese entertainment industry firms Huayi Brothers
                    and Beijing Enlight Media.
